				<h2>CST Courses</h2>
				<img src="images/stickynotes.jpg" height="160" width="240" alt="stickynotes"><p>The courses in CST are incredibly fun. It’s true, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t tough. Most of the courses are intensive, while others aren’t as intensive. Some of them are not hard at all; however, all of them provide you with a lot of work to do. All of this combined results in a very intensive program. As intensive as it is, it’s still a great environment to learn in due to your peers, instructors, and <a href="pages/resources.html">resources</a>.</p>

				<p>You may experience some highs and lows, but everyone goes through them and your classmates are always there to help you along. This program is intensive, that is the truth, but everyone has the potential to pass and get an outstanding career in an exploding industry.</p>

				<p>Some of the concepts and topics you’ll explore in the first term of CST include Java, HTML, binary math and logic, and even business practices in the IT industry. In the second term, you’ll be introduced to C, software design techniques, and more advanced Java. After either the first term or second term, depending on the time of your intake, you’ll have your practicum: A five-week term completely focused on working on a project with a small team of your classmates. Entering your third term you’ll be choosing one of the many different options CST offers, each resulting in a different diploma at the end of the fourth term. You probably won't get much of a break during each term. Was it mentioned that the program is intensive?
