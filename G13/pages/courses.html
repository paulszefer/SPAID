				<!-- Term 1 -->
                <div id="comp1510description" class="coursedescription">
                    <p>This course is the foundation for most courses that follow it. It introduces the programming language Java, and teaches students important building blocks, along with COMP 1536, for their programming future. Java is the most commonly used programming language, and many of its concepts are suitable for beginners. As such, this is the most important term 1 course and it’s a pre-requisite for most of the term 2 courses.</p>

				<div id="comp1536description" class="coursedescription">
                    <p>COMP 1536 is an introduction to web design and development. It teaches students HTML, CSS, and some client-side JavaScript and server-side scripting. It also helps students work on their planning and collaboration skills. Along with learning best practices for coding, students will come out with a strong ability to create web pages using HTML and style them appropriately using CSS.</p>

				<div id="comp1113description" class="coursedescription">
                    <p>COMP 1113 introduces beginner discrete mathematics and linear equations.  The focus of this course is to build a strong foundation for upcoming programming and technical courses.  It is separated into three different sections.  Opening with functions, linear equations, vectors and matrices.  Then number systems and data representation.  Finally, Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits.  This course is further continued in term 2 with COMP 2121 Discrete Mathematics.</p>
