            <h2>What is CST?</h2>
            <p>Computer Systems Technology (CST) is a highly-sought after program offered by BCIT. CST is a two-year diploma program that fuses computer science with practical experience in software development. You’ll learn software engineering and programming from industry professionals, and gain experience working on real projects, from concept to deployment. In your third term in CST, you get to choose your preferred option -- a specialized area of study -- and take courses corresponding to that option.</p>

            <p>In CST, you’ll be introduced to core skills and theory used in software development. You’ll also be required to work as a part of a team to design and build an application. Second year is when you pick what specialty you want to go into. Currently there are <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/5500dipma#cs" target="”_blank”">eight different options</a> to choose from. The number of courses is reduced; however, the level of work is increased. During second year, you’ll also be engaged with real-world industry projects. In CST, students are grouped into sets of about 25 students, and you stay with the same set for the first two terms. In terms 3 and 4, depending on what option you choose, you’ll be put into a new set.</p><br>
