				<p>There are four terms in the program.  For the first year, there are seven courses per term.  The work is moderately hard but the volume is immense.  You’ll be introduced to core skills and theory used in software development.  You’ll also be required to work as a part of a team to design and build an application.

Overall, you’re put into sets of about 25 students, and you stay with the same set for the first two terms.
