                    <h2>Stephanie Hu</h2>
                    <p>When someone says they are in the computing field, most of you would think of traditional stereotypes that connects the two. In addition of studying and coding, I have a burning passion for dance. Most of my time spent outside of school is on training dance. It is either with my crew, at studios or at home, as I hope to enter more dance battles or perform on big stages in the near future. I also enjoy singing and making song covers at home with friends.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the more artsy side of me, martial arts and playing ball sports are hobbies of mine as well. Nothing else is better than a whole day of dance training followed up with a night of basketball! Prior to attending BCIT CST, I studied American Sign Language (ASL) Interpretation which is another thing I am extremely passionate about. With all these I would like to say I challenge those typical traits of computing students!</p>
                    <p>My tip to do well in CST is find the right people to study with and ask for help. Don’t ever be scared to look stupid because everyone has to start somewhere. When it comes to learning, you can only get better and not worse at something. Once you learn it, it is yours! Do your best not to procrastinate your labs! I have learned it the hard way; you definitely retain the information taught you a lot better when you are not under pressure trying to get it done. </p>

                    <p>Hey! I’m Paul. I like to play soccer and solve programming puzzles. The best thing about the CST program is the amount of practical experience you get. Nearly every course has an associated lab where you get hands-on practice with the course material. One way to do well in CST is to stay on top of your courses. Everything is cumulative. Each concept that you learn will be applied again and again throughout your programming career.</p>

                    <p>CST sure is fun isn't it? Especially when you come from a completely irrelevant background, Commerce / Account Management, like myself. Loaded with infinite amount of work and no fun time, it sure will make you miss your social life. However, it sure seems like a program you will benefit from, especially when you make it out the other end. I use to enjoy things like sports, gaming, and something called friends... well life in general, but it all just is ancient history. It's alright though, I guess we can all sacrifice 2 years.</p>
                    <p>Guys, if you ever want to see the light of graduation in CST, make sure you stay ahead of your materials at all time. Don't procrastinate like me, always read ahead unlike me, and you shall succeed!</p>

                    <h2>Ian Younghusband</h2>
                    <p>Hey, my name is Ian Younghusband. I took a year of engineering education before switching to CST because it’s much more interesting. I enjoy playing video games, rock-climbing, and skiing when possible. My go-to tip for being successful is to make good friends; find people to work with because it’ll make the hard times easier and it’s great motivation to keep up your work ethic!</p>

                    <h2>Devan Purhar</h2>
                    <p>Hey it’s me, Devan Purhar.  I’m an easy-going fella with a good sense of humour.  A couple of activities I enjoy would be hanging out with my friends (who doesn’t), playing hockey, golfing and staring at beautiful cars.  Something interesting about me would be that I play hockey in the PJHL, a Junior B league for the lower mainland.  My tip to do well in CST would be to work ahead on your assignments before they’re given.  That way you’ll have enough time to get help if you’re having trouble.</p>
