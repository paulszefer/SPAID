            <h2>BCIT Computer Systems Technology</h2>

                <p>Computer Systems Technology (CST) is a highly-sought after program offered by BCIT. 
                CST is a two-year diploma program that fuses computer science with practical experience 
                in software development. 
                <br>
                You’ll learn software engineering and programming from industry 
                professionals, and gain experience working on real projects, from concept to deployment. 
                In your third term in CST, you get to choose your 
                <br>preferred option -- a specialized area of study -- and take courses corresponding to that option.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To learn more about CST, visit BCIT main CST page <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/5500dipma" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <div id="programinfo">
                <h2>Program Information</h2>

                <p>
                In CST, you’ll be introduced to core skills and theory used in software 
                development. You’ll also be required to work as a part of a team to design 
                and build an application. Second year is when you pick what specialty 
                <br>you want to go into. Currently there are eight different options to choose from. 
                The number of courses is reduced; however, the level of work is increased. 
                During second year, you’ll also be engaged with real-world 
                <br>industry projects. In CST, students are grouped into sets of about 25 
                students, and you stay with the same set for the first two terms. In terms 3 and 4, depending on what option 
                you choose, you’ll be put into a new set.
                </p>
