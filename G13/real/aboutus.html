    <p class="biop">When someone says they are in the computing field, most of you would think of traditional stereotypes that connects the two. In addition of studying and coding, I have a burning passion for dance. Most of my time spent outside of school is on training dance. It is either with my crew, at studios or at home, as I hope to enter more dance battles or perform on big stages in the near future. I also enjoy singing and making song covers at home with friends.
    <br><br>
    Aside from the more artsy side of me, martial arts and playing ball sports are hobbies of mine as well. Nothing else is better than a whole day of dance training followed up with a night of basketball! Prior to attending BCIT CST, I studied American Sign Language (ASL) Interpretation which is another thing I am extremely passionate about. With all these I would like to say I challenge those typical traits of computing students!
    <br><br>
    My tip to do well in CST is find the right people to study with and ask for help. Don’t ever be scared to look stupid because everyone has to start somewhere. When it comes to learning, you can only get better and not worse at something. Once you learn it, it is yours! Do your best not to procrastinate your labs! I have learned it the hard way; you definitely retain the information taught you a lot better when you are not under pressure trying to get it done.</p>

    <p class="biop">CST sure is fun isn't it?  Especially when you come from a completely irrelevant 
    background, Commerce / Account Management, like myself.  Loaded with infinite amount of work and 
    no fun time, it sure will make you miss your social life.  However, it sure seems like a program 
    you will benefit from, especially when you make it out the other end.  I use to enjoy things like 
    sports, gaming, and something called friends... well life in general, but it all just is ancient 
    history.  It's alright though, I guess we can all sacrifice 2 years.
    <br><br>
    Guys, if you ever want to see the light of graduation in CST, make sure you stay ahead of your materials
    at all time.  Don't procrastinate like me, always read ahead unlike me, and you shall succeed!</p>

    <p class="biop">Hey, my name is Ian Younghusband. I took a year of engineering education before switching to CST because it’s much more interesting. I enjoy playing video games, rock-climbing, and skiing when possible. My go-to tip for being successful is to make good friends; find people to work with because it’ll make the hard times easier and it’s great motivation to keep up your work ethic!</p>
